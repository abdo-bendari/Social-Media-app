# About 

This is a social media application built with Node.js and MongoDB, designed to allow users to share posts, follow other users, comment, and like posts. The app features user authentication, secure password management, media uploads (images and videos), and role-based access control for certain actions. Users can create and manage personal profiles, share posts with text and media, and follow and interact with other users through likes, comments, and sharing posts. The application provides functionalities such as signing in, signing up, changing passwords, and allows users to edit or delete their own comments, ensuring a smooth user experience. Additionally, users can view a personalized timeline based on the accounts they follow and experience real-time updates on likes and comments. This project focuses on providing a robust and scalable backend, ensuring smooth user interactions, secure data management, and an enjoyable experience for all users.

## Project Inspiration

This project was inspired by the need for a platform that fosters community engagement and interaction in a digital space. Observing the success of existing social media platforms, I aimed to create a simplified yet effective solution that allows users to share their thoughts, connect with others, and express themselves through multimedia content. The desire to enhance user experience through real-time interactions and secure data handling further motivated the development of this social media app. The goal was to build a user-friendly environment that encourages authentic communication while prioritizing privacy and security.
